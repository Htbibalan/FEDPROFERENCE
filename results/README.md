### Bodyweight
![bodyweight](https://github.com/Htbibalan/FEDPROFERENCE/blob/main/plots/bodyweight.png)
* no difference in bodyweight of the mice after 20 days of diet manipulation

### Food intake

![foodintake](https://github.com/Htbibalan/FEDPROFERENCE/blob/main/plots/foodintake.png)
* After 13 days female PR mice increase their intake however males show a difference after 16 days. However the bodyweight remains similar among the two groups at this point.

### EchoMRI
After almost 1 month being on diet, ***only female PR mice have higher fat mass*** compared to female NR mice. However at the day of scan, female PR mice also have higher body weight

### Choice sessions
##### S1 CAS20 vs CAS5
Female and male mice prefer CAS20 over CAS5 regardless of their diet history.
***Male PR mice take more CAS20*** compared to male NR mice.
Male PR mice shows a circadian difference by taking more meals and more pellets per hour during day time.

##### S2 CAS20 vs SUC
Female and Male mice prefer CAS20 over SUC regardless of their diet history.
***Male PR mice take more CAS20*** compared to male NR mice, these mice also show circadian difference by taking more meals and more pellets per hour during the day.

##### S3 CAS5 vs SUC
Female and male mice prefer CAS5 over SUC regardless of their diet type.
***Male PR mice take more CAS 5 compared with male NR mice***.

##### S4 CAS5 vs SUC CE

![GroupBreakpointPlot1](https://github.com/Htbibalan/FEDPROFERENCE/blob/main/plots/GroupBreakpointPlot1.png)
Female and male mice prefer CAS5 over SUC in either groups.
* <font color = "red"> PR female mice take fewer CAS 5 which is reflected in number of pellets or number of meals, however PR female mice make more poke to get CAS5 but it is not significant. Also PR female mice take fewer SUC pellets during day time.

* <font color = "purple">  PR male mice make more pokes to get **CAS5** pellets however total number of pellets taken is similar. PR male mice also make more pokes to get **SUC** pellets however total number of pellets taken is similar, but they have higher number of meals.
