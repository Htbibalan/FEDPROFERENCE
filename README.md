# FEDPROFERENCE
The repository stores the codes and data files collected in an experiment in which protein restricted and non-restricted mice were placed in choice boxes to choose between diets varying in nutritional value to test their preference as a function of their diet history.

##### Number of animals: 40 mice, 20 male and 20 female

##### Age: 6 weeks at the time of arrival, ~8 weeks at the begining of the experiment depending on batch number

##### Strain:  C57BL/6NRj

*The figures show the overview of the 4 batches used in this experiment, plus the overall protocol for each cohort of animals and the choices in "food preference sessions"*


##### Cohorots
* 2 main cohorts of protein-restricted and non-restriced mice, each containing 20 mice distributed in 4 batches
* **FEDXD01-10 F** and **FEDXD01-10 M** are protein-restricted mice
* **FEDXD11-20 F** and **FEDXD11-20 M** are non-restricted mice
* This [Metafile](https://github.com/Htbibalan/FEDPROFERENCE/blob/main/FEDXD_METAFILE.xls) shows the corresponding batches for each mouse 


40 mice used in this study, 20 male and 20 female - 10 male PR 10 female PR vs 10 male NR 10 female NR
The mice started with 3 days of training with FEDs set on FF mode, filled with 50-50% mix of CAS 5 and 20 pellets.
After training, mice were placed in standard cages, maintained on large PR or NR pellets.
After 7 days of diet manipulation, they were placed in CHOICE box, where they could choose from 2 FEDs , Session 1) FR1 20 vs 5 Session 2)FR1 20 vs Suc Session 3)FR1 5 vs Suc Session 4)CE 5 vs SUC

Body weight was measured 4 times across the experiment, i.e. time 0 after 7 days of being on diet and then every 3 days i.e. on the day the mice were placed in the choice box.


Extra:
After the last session of choice, the mice were maintained on their diets for 7-3 more days(depending on the batch number) and eventually they were placed in the EchoMRI machine for scanning body composition.
